# Definitive Math381 final project
 The goal of this project is to determine the optimal location to open up a donut shop in Seattle. Our approach is to interpret easily obtained public data through the lens of a minisum location problem with some steps to reduce the computation cost via area restriction and simplied product demand. We extract an undirected node graph of Seattle from publicly available data and interpolate population in ZIP Code demarcated regions into node weights of intersections in the city. Once this is done we apply our minisum optimization to nd ideally situated locations built with the assumptions of our model. As a test of our model's predictions of real world results we compare prediction vs actual location of donut shops in Seattle.
